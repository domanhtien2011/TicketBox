**shielded-peak-56294** is a Ruby on Rails blog application that allows users to create and buy tickets to cool events. 

Submitted by: **Tien Manh Do**

Time spent: **25** hours

URL: **https://shielded-peak-56294.herokuapp.com/**

SimpleCov Test Coverage: **82.14%**

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] 10 model tests, 2 route tests, 2 controller tests, 2 view tests.

#### Events

* [x] Users can see a list of upcoming events. Past events should not be shown. **HINT**: Good candidate for a test.
* [x] Users can search for events from the homepage.
* [x] Users can click on an event to see details about the event. 
* [x] Users can click on "Book Now" to go to a page to purchase tickets.

#### Tickets

* [x] Each event can have multiple types of tickets, each with a different `price` and `max_quantity`. 
* [ ] Users can buy tickets to an event, choose the types of tickets, and the quantity of tickets.
* [ ] Users cannot buy more tickets than the quantity available.
* [ ] Users can only buy up to 10 of a ticket type at a time.
* [x] Users cannot buy tickets to events that occur in the past. 

#### Users

* [x] User can sign up by providing their email, password, and name. 
* [x] User can login using an email and password. 
* [x] Users can create events. 
* [x] Users must click "publish event" before an event becomes viewable to other users. 
* [x] Users can create ticket types for that event. 
* [x] Users can create venues.
* [x] An event must have at least one `ticket_type` defined before it can be published. 
* [x] User can see a list of events he or she has created.
* [x] Users can edit their event after creation. But only the user who created the event can edit the event. 

### Optional Stories

* [ ] Users can log in with Facebook.
* [ ] Users receive an email when they have purchased a ticket.
* [ ] Users can see "related events" when browsing an event. Related events should belong to the same category and be in the same region.
* [ ] User A can allow User B to edit User A's event. In other words, an event owner can assign other people to be "event admins". 
* [ ] Ticket types have an optional "minimum" purchase quantity. ([Example Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/DOYtAR0.png))
* [ ] Events are automatically labeled as "Hot". "Hot" events should have a red border or some sort of visual flourish. The event title should also be prefixed with "**HOT:**".
* [ ] Instead of showing all of the events on the main page, an "admin" user can dictate the events that show up on the main page.

## Notes

*I believe that my test coverage for the event model is 100%, I don't know why it complains that I haven't tested the methods in the event.rb file.*

**The most difficult obstacle for this assignment is I couldn't figure out a way to allow the user to purchase a ticket. I think I am confused about the ticket and ticket_type controllers. Particularly, how can I pass all the values from new ticket page to the ticket controller because obviously there is no relationship between ticket_types and ticket. In addition, I tried to create a relationship between them, but it still doesn't work. Hopefully, after grading my assignment, you can give me a suggestion for this feature.**
